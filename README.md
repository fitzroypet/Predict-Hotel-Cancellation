This project is an exercise in the Intro to Deep Learning Course on Kaggle where I gained pactical experience with Deep Learning Framwork using Keras in Tensorflow.

GOAL 

To build a model to predict hotel cancellations with a binary classifier.

STEPS IN THIS PROJECT

# 1) Define Model #

Building the binary classification model with the addition of both batch normalization and dropout layers.

# 2) Add Optimizer, Loss, and Metric #

Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and binary versions of the cross-entropy loss and accuracy metric.

# 3) Train and Evaluate #

Training and evaluating the model's learning curve. Analysing the curve to spot underfittting or overfitting using cross-entropy loss and accuracy as key parformance metrics for the model.
