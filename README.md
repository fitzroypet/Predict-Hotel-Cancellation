This project is an exercise in the Intro to Deep Learning Course on Kaggle where I gained practical experience with Deep Learning Framework using Keras in Tensorflow.

GOAL 

To build a model to predict hotel cancellations with a binary classifier.

STEPS IN THIS PROJECT

### 1) Define Model

Building the binary classification model with the addition of both batch normalisation and dropout layers.

### 2) Add Optimizer, Loss, and Metric

Compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and binary versions of the cross-entropy loss and accuracy metric.

### 3) Train and Evaluate

Training and evaluating the model's learning curve. Analysing the curve to spot underfitting or overfitting using cross-entropy loss and accuracy as key performance metrics for the model.
